# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
How many times are you asked about aggregated data involving your wildlife patients? What is the turn-around time of retrieving that data? How accurate is that data? How much money did you just miss out on (donation, fundraiser, volunteer time) when retrieving what is now outdating information because you had to count individual patient records. How many lives (wildlife) were lost without being able to immediately take note of a virus or missed flagged anomolies?

I am proposing that you do away with the paper trail! You can now have a centralized web application that holds all of your current and past patients. With this application, you and your staff will be able to effienciently keep track of all your patients and accurately access various reports for internal or external purposes. 
### Features
1. Patient Intake: Users will be able to check-in a new patient (or create a new patient record). New patients will appear on the inital home page in order of admission date.
2. Update patient: Users will be able to update patient information while in the care of the hospital. For example, a user can add a new timestamp with most recent weight, on-going medical records, physical therapy results.
3. Search: Users will be able to search for a specific patient containg a given text.
4. Data Visualization: Users will be able to create various reports based on user query definitions. For example, a user can create an aggregated report of patients based on species (553 common murres, 174 striped skunks, etc).
### Technologies
- Java
- Springboot
- Thymeleaf
- MySQL
- Bootstrap

### What I'll Have to Learn
Data visualization: I need to identify what type of technique (?javascript?) to use in order to provide interactive and real-time charts.
